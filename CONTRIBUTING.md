day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Fix a bug, refactor code or expand an existing feature.
* Use the right syntax and naming conventions.
* Update parts of the documentation that are affected by your contribution.
